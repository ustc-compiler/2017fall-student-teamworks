## Overview

Much different from Class-based Inheritance, as a style of object-oriented programming, Prototypal Inheritance provides a novel approach of reusing data.

**Here's a quick view of the phenomenon:**

```javascript
var foo = {name: "foo", one: 1, two: 2};
// another object
var bar = {two: "two", three: 3};
Object.setPrototypeOf(bar, foo); // foo is now the prototype of bar.
bar.one // Resolves to 1.
```
## Our Project's Description

In this project, we will do a simple survey on the phenomenon of Prototypal Inheritance. We will mainly cover in:

- Concepts of Prototypal Inheritance [songchaow]
- Genesis(origin) of prototype-based programming model [songchaow]

We will discuss the design ideas that Prototype-based Programming has adopted, including `delegation`, `extension` and other concepts from `Frame Theory` and a small language called `Actor`.

- The benefits of Prototypal Inheritance towards programmers [Smart-Hypercube, nvagus]
- The embodiment of Prototypal Inheritance in several programming languages(such as `JavaScript`) and their usages [Smart-Hypercube]
- The implementation of Prototypal Inheritance we'll try on `Python`. [nvagus, https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/python3-proto]

Though `Python` itself already has some properties of Prototypal Inheritance(e.g. we can dynamically add attributes to an object instantiated from a class), We plan to implement a Prototypal Inheritance system that does not require our own definition of classes, providing full-featured interfaces without resort of classes via Python's decorators.
  
## Journal

- By Dec 23rd, 2017.
  * Discussion on QQ: scheduling.
  * Concept and origin: information collected.
  * Implementation on Python(namely, **python3-proto** project): utils confirmed.
- By Jan 3rd, 2017
  * Documents: 
  
    - a repository for documents has been established([documents repository](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/documents)). 
  
    - songchaow analyzed general features and design philosophy of prototype-based programming compared to class-based programming.(the first part of [README.md](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/documents/blob/master/README.md))

    - Smart-Hypercube added his insights into protypal inheritance on the designing level, and poited out some implementation mechanisms of prototype characteristics related to `Python` and `Javascript`.(the second part of [README.md](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/documents/blob/master/README.md))

  * [**python3-proto**](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/python3-proto) project:
  
    nvagus reorganized the structure of this project.

- By Jan 13rd, 2018

  Discussion at Library in West Campus for 1 hour.

  Discussion on QQ for all day.

  * Documents:

    The report for this project has been published in [document repository](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/documents). [songchaow]

  * [**python3-proto**](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/python3-proto) project:
    
    The [README.md](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/documents/blob/master/README.md) has been added. [nvagus]]

    Lots of comments has been added to python codes. [nvagus]
  * PPT for report

    The PDF version of PPT for report has been added. [Smart-Hypercube]

  * Discussion with other groups:

    We asked questions about technical details of other teams' work and received enthusiastic responses from Groups 4 and 13.

    See the issue pages of their repos for details.



<!--## To-do List
- Continue to read the paper, *Classifying Prototype-based Programming Language*, study several programming languages the paper has mentioned, and finally sort out how prototype-based languages are influenced by other languages before. [songchaow]

- The [Readme.md](https://github.com/compiler-teamwork-group09/documents/blob/master/README.md) file in the document repository is yet lacking structural organization, though lots of useful points are available from it. We plan to reorganize the document later.-->
